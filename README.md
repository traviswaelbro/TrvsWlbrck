Personal Site Development

This version is what I had hosted on my personal site, however not all features work while hosted on GitHub Pages due to the lack of PHP functionality. For example, the form will not send because PHP is not supported.

This is my own personal site, which will be used to showcase my work and allow clients (and other parties) to contact me. 

### v0.1
The current site is simply a placeholder to have an online presence while the full site is being developed. It only holds buttons for social media and an email link.

### v0.2
This will be a minor update to provide basic info about who I am, what services I can provide, etc. It will still be very far from the full site. Main purpose at this stage will be for traffic received from links in customer sites.

### v0.5
I am hoping to have the majority of the site content up and navigable by this point, but not necessarily have the design completely nailed down. Likely to be somewhat buggy and have few animations.

### v1.0
Initial full-featured site release. Planned to have a unified design with several animations that contribute to the usefulness of the site. It will have examples of completed customer sites, site templates, and customer reviews.
